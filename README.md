## üìò Abstract
The growing computational demands of machine learning have raised concerns about the environmental sustainability of artificial intelligence (AI), especially in domains like remote sensing.  
This project benchmarks four lightweight deep learning architectures:
- **MobileNetV3**
- **EfficientNet-Lite0**
- **H-NAS (Simulated Hypernetwork NAS)**
- **Custom Lightweight CNN**

Real-time tracking of emissions and energy usage is conducted using CodeCarbon.  
The **EuroSAT RGB dataset** is used for land-use classification, demonstrating that high accuracy can be achieved with **minimal carbon emissions** and **low energy consumption**.
